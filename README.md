# narrative

School project with the following requirements:

Build a website that expresses a story (fiction or non-fiction) about a person or event. 

 1-5 page (1 scrolling site with several sections or a multipage site with navigation) 

It can have an open structure or follow a sequential path. You must include text, images and/or other media, like audio, video or gif animations.
