                <h2>Project Statement</h2>
                <p>This website was a project for a multimedia authoring class project where we were challenged to</p>
                <p>create a narrative story in which I decided to utilize the program Skrollr.</p>
                <p>My inspiration for this project was drawn from the iconic Super Mario games.</p>
                <p>The biggest challenge I faced was creating visually stunning graphics and animations</p>
                <p>that were both engaging and coherent with the Super Mario theme. Through diligent research and iteration,</p>
                <p>I was able to overcome these challenges and create a website that effectively captured the essence of</p>
                <p>Super Mario while showcasing mu technical skills with Skrollr and multimedia authoring.</p>
